Many parts of the body are susceptible to sprains, strains, breaks, and damage that can interfere with your activity or result in permanent issues. When preparing to participate in any sport, determine what safety equipment may be needed to protect the athlete as much as possible. Be sure the equipment is properly sized and in good condition.

      "Are you in it for the long haul?  I Train First Thing in the Morning.   We know we all mean well but how many of us let little things get in the way.  When you say you plan to work out later does it ever happen.  After a day of school, uni, or work, socializing and more, it just doesn’t happen for most of us. The best way I can stay committed to my path is to identify and create a plan. Know what your goals are and insure you stick to the plan.

That’s why Erin Parker says you should work out early in your day.“Prioritize your training, wake up early, and make the time to just get it done. You’ll feel fantastic to have the rest of your day ahead with training already complete.” Erin is a national level olympic weightlifter and CEO of Spitfire Athlete, a top strength training app for women.Training with Spitfire Athlete is about celebrating our bodies for what they can do rather than what they look like. It’s about practicing the warrior’s mentality of strength, mental toughness, grit and dedication.",
